### 9/15/24

# T3 Seraphim Submarine
Slight Nerf to Seraphim Submarine to prevent the meta where you would shift g 5-6 seraphim subs on top of each other and their torp defense would infinitely be able to defend a SIGNIFICANT amount of torps.

# T2 Destroyers
All Torpedo Defense on Destroyers significantly buffed should be able to crush T1 Subs at a relative similar cost efficiency

# T2 Torpedo Bombers
Torpedo Bombers nerfed to original 800-860 Health Values with a slight increase in E cost & M cost.
Relative Cost increase was 2k more e and 50 more mass

# Bombers
Fixed Bombers not dropping bombs properly also nerfs dodge micro against bombers as well, i.e means early bombers and such are much stronger and harder to dodge

# T2 Static Flak & T3 Static Flak
-- Buff Flak against Gunships & Remove most of it's usefulness against fast flying strategic bombers and fighters (Making sams more useful)
Comparable Values to the Static except higher rank and generally more damage (although of course more cost)

Removed Stealth

# Misc

Evenflow is now integrated into Economy & Flow. It is now strongly recommended to use this version as it goes hand and hand with LCE.

-- T1 & T2 were overperforming especially T1 Land against both T2 & T3, similarly T2 was overperforming vs T3. The intended purpose of this change is to extend the gap between tiers.

### 9/2/2024 (V1.0.0 Release)

# Reclaim Changes
-- Reclaim Changes were simple. The Single Goal in Mind was to encourage early aggression but punish late game mistakes i.e losing entire army without delivering significant damage.
All Wrecks have been fixed to prevent permanent disappear of Wreckage/Reclaim
Overkill Ratio on Wreckage disappearing has been changed from 10% to 30% meaning you have to overkill said unit by 30% to not receive the wreckage
Naval Reclaim no lower gives 30% of the energy in the Wreckage

# T3 Penetration Bombers
-- Pen Bombers are very strong, with the ability to easily punch through most AA & having cheap stealth. This change was needed to prevent early Pen Bomber Rushes specifically in Teamgames. Many changes are aimed at some of the first steps towards significantly diversifying units
Aeon:
Mass Cost 4300 -> 5300
Energy Cost 165000 -> 195000
Stealth Energy Cost Upkeep 50 -> 250
MaxAirspeed 19 -> 17
MinAirspeed 15 -> 14
TurnSpeed 1.0 -> 1.1
UEF: 
Mass Cost 4750 -> 5750
Energy Cost 180000 -> 2100000
Stealth Energy Cost Upkeep 50 -> 300
Health 6800 -> 7200
MaxAirspeed 19 -> 18

# T3 Static Artillery
Revert to the FAF Cost of T3 Static Artillery

# T2 Aeon Sniper
-- The Aeon Sniper was dominating T2, T3, and even early T4 Phase in some games, this called for a immediate nerf. It's main strength lies in its speed and with the reduction, it should allow players to catch them much easier. The cost will also make them less efficient and the EnergyRequired will make the Reload much longer as well by 3 more seconds.
Mass Cost 320 -> 465 
Energy Cost 3850 -> 5050
MaxSpeed 4.0 -> 3.8
EnergyRequired (Recharge - Main Weapon) 880 -> 1320

# T3 Mobile Sensor Arrays
-- Mobile Sensor Arrays Omni was too small combined with the small omni on static radar led to Stealth & Cloak being far too powerful & annoying for players.
Energy Cost Upkeep 850 -> 1500
OmniRadius 56 -> 112
