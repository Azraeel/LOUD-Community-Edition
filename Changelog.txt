# Reclaim Changes
-- Reclaim Changes were simple. The Single Goal in Mind was to encourage early aggression but punish late game mistakes i.e losing entire army without delivering significant damage.
All Wrecks have been fixed to prevent permanent disappear of Wreckage/Reclaim
Overkill Ratio on Wreckage disappearing has been changed from 10% to 30% meaning you have to overkill said unit by 30% to not receive the wreckage
Naval Reclaim no lower gives 30% of the energy in the Wreckage

# T3 Penetration Bombers
-- Pen Bombers are very strong, with the ability to easily punch through most AA & having cheap stealth. This change was needed to prevent early Pen Bomber Rushes specifically in Teamgames. Many changes are aimed at some of the first steps towards significantly diversifying units

# T3 Static Artillery
Revert to the FAF Cost of T3 Static Artillery

# T2 Aeon Sniper
-- The Aeon Sniper was dominating T2, T3, and even early T4 Phase in some games, this called for a immediate nerf. It's main strength lies in its speed and with the reduction, it should allow players to catch them much easier. The cost will also make them less efficient and the EnergyRequired will make the Reload much longer as well by 3 more seconds.
Mass Cost 320 -> 465 
Energy Cost 3850 -> 5050
MaxSpeed 4.0 -> 3.8
EnergyRequired (Recharge - Main Weapon) 880 -> 1320

# T3 Mobile Sensor Arrays
-- Mobile Sensor Arrays Omni was too small combined with the small omni on static radar led to Stealth & Cloak being far too powerful & annoying for players.
Energy Cost Upkeep 850 -> 1500
OmniRadius 56 -> 112
